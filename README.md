# Tail Risk-Managed Portfolios

This GitHub repository contains the Python code accompanying the master's thesis titled "Tail Risk-Managed Portfolios" by Gwenael-Theo MÃ¼nker. The thesis explores the construction and performance evaluation of portfolios managed to mitigate tail risks using Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) metrics derived from option-implied probability measures.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - This file, explaining the project and navigation.
- `risk_analysis.py` - Main Python script containing all the functions and logic for data processing, RND calculation, and portfolio management strategies.
- `data/` - Directory containing the datasets used (note: due to privacy and data sharing policies, actual data files are not included in this repository).

## Prerequisites

To run the scripts, ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed, along with the following packages:
- `pandas` for data manipulation,
- `numpy` for numerical calculations,
- `matplotlib` for plotting graphs,
- `scipy` for optimization functions,
- `cvxpy` along with the `MOSEK` solver for optimization problems.

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy cvxpy mosek
